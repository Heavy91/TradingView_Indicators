## Indicators:

- **RSI MultiTimeframe:**
  Plots 3 RSI (Weekly, Daily, 4h) at the same time, regardless of the Chart Timeframe.
  Highlights in green (or red) if all RSI are oversold (or overbought).
  Can trigger custom oversold and overbought alerts.
  
- **Volume Supply and Demand Zones:**
  Draws supply and demand zones based on 3 different volume threshold parameters.
  The timeframe of the script is fixed (you can change it in the options), 
  e.g. it is possible to keep Daily S/D zones while looking at 1h chart.
